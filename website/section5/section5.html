                Who will be responsible for implementing the Magna Carta of Women?
            </h1>
            <p>The State, the private sector, society in general, and all individuals shall
                contribute to the recognition, respect and promotion of the rights of women
                defined and guaranteed in the Magna Carta of Women.
                The Philippine Government shall be the primary duty-bearer in
                implementing the said law. This means that all government offices,
                including local government units and government-owned and controlled
                corporations shall be responsible to implement the provisions of Magna
                Carta of Women that falls within their mandate, particularly those that
                guarantee rights of women that require specific action from the State.
                As the primary duty-bearer, the Government is tasked to:<br>
                • refrain from discriminating against women and violating their
                rights;<br>
                • protect women against discrimination and from violation of their
                rights by private corporations,
                entities, and individuals;<br>
                • promote and fulfill the rights of women in all spheres, including
                their rights to substantive equality
                and non-discrimination.<br>
                The Government shall fulfill these duties through the development and
                implementation of laws, policies, regulatory instruments, administrative
                guidelines, and other appropriate measures, including temporary special
                measures. It shall also establish mechanisms to promote the coherent and
                integrated implementation of the Magna Carta of Women and other related
                laws and policies to effectively stop discrimination against Filipino women.</p>
