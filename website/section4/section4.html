                How can Filipino women living abroad benefit from this law?
            </h1>
            <p>Statistics show that more and more Filipino women are migrating for
                overseas employment. In many places, women migrant workers have
                limited legal protections or access to information about their rights,
                rendering them vulnerable to gender-specific discrimination, exploitation
                and abuse. Section 37 of the Magna Carta of Women mandates the designation of a
                gender focal point in the consular section of Philippine embassies or
                consulates. The said officer who shall be trained on Gender and
                Development shall be primarily responsible in handling gender concerns of
                women migrant workers, especially those in distress. Other agencies (e.g.
                the Department of Labor and Employment and the Department of Social
                Welfare and Development) are also mandated to cooperate in strengthening
                the Philippine foreign posts' programs for the delivery of services to women
                migrant workers, consistent with the one-country team approach in Foreign
                Service.</p>
