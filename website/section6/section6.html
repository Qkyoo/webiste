                    Carta of Women?</h2>
                <p>The Magna Carta of Women mandates all government offices, including
                    government-owned and controlled corporations and local government units
                    to adopt gender mainstreaming as a strategy for implementing the law and
                    attaining its objectives. It also mandates (a) planning, budgeting, monitoring
                    and evaluation for gender and development, (b) the creation and/or
                    strengthening of gender and development focal points, and (c) the
                    generation and maintenance of gender statistics and sex-disaggregated
                    databases to aid in planning, programming and policy formulation.</p>

                <h2>What are the penalties of violators?</h2>
                <p>If the violation is committed by a government agency or any government
                    office, including government-owned and controlled corporations and local
                    government units, the person directly responsible for the violation, as well
                    as the head of the agency or local chief executive shall be held liable under
                    the Magna Carta of Women. The sanctions under administrative law, civil
                    service or other appropriate laws shall be recommended by the Commission
                    on Human Rights to the Civil Service Commission and the Department of

                <h2>How will the implementation of the Magna Carta of Women be
                    funded?</h2>
                <p>The Magna Carta of Women provides that the State agencies should utilize
                    their gender and development budgets for programs and activities to
                    implement its provisions. Funds necessary for the implementation of the
                    Magna Carta of Women shall be charged against the current appropriations
                    of the concerned agencies, and shall be included in their annual budgets for
                    the succeeding years.</p>

                    publication in at least two (2) newspapers of general circulation.</p>
